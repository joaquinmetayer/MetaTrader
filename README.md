# MetaTrader
 
All my archives used in MetaTrader 4 / 5 platform for trading since 2018.

In folder MQL5.com you will find the .ex4 created by me that you can download from the market at https://www.mql5.com/en/users/joaquinmetayer/seller or searching "joaquinmetayer" directly from the platform.

In folder opensource-mq4 you will find the .mq4 file of [Odie Trade Manager EA](https://www.mql5.com/en/market/product/61929?source=Site+Profile+Seller) and [Retxed EA](https://www.mql5.com/en/market/product/67307?source=Site+Profile+Seller).

These tools were programmed:

A -  With the help of the community that is within MT4 that exposes codes that they have created and / or want to correct, taking them, adjusting it, improving, optimizing and publishing it for its correct operation and use.

B - Based on a system idea that I have created myself, programmed by a third party to obtain the "raw" code and give it the final adjustments to go to market.

Tip: MQL4 lenguage is similar to JavaScript.

** It should be noted that none of these tools were completely/from scratch programmed.

You will only find the files compiled to .ex4 since they are the only ones I have and the ones that are really worth it.

The files Account Protecor and Position Size Calculator they were created by https://www.earnforex.com/ which I repost here as a backup in case the site ceases to exist.
