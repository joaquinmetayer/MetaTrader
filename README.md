# MetaTrader

All my archives used in MT4.

In folder MQL5.com you will find the .ex4 created by me that you can download from the market at https://www.mql5.com/en/users/joaquinmetayer/seller or searching "joaquinmetayer" directly from the platform.

The files Account Protecor and Position Size Calculator they were created by https://www.earnforex.com/ which I repost here as a backup in case the site ceases to exist.
